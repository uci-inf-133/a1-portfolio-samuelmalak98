<p>
  I am a Computer Science and Engineering student focused on building reliable and practical technology solutions. 
  My academic background has introduced me to programming, digital systems, and structured problem solving, and I enjoy 
  turning technical requirements into working software.
</p>

<p>
  Through my coursework, I have developed experience with algorithmic thinking, debugging, and collaborative development. 
  I am especially interested in systems-level programming, embedded applications, and software design that connects hardware and software.
</p>

<p>
  I created this portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS to demonstrate my understanding of web fundamentals, 
  responsive design, and accessibility. I am currently seeking internships and entry-level opportunities where I can contribute, 
  continue learning, and grow as an engineer.
</p>
